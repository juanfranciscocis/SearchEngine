Not knowing that this was his own son, Lord Shiva who was quick to anger grew enraged. Not used to be disobeyed he cut off the boy\'92s head.

He fell down and died.The other frog continued to jump as hard as he could. Once again, the crowd of frogs yelled at him to stop the pain and just die. He jumped even harder and finally made it out. When he got out, the other frogs said, \'93Did you not hear us?\'94 The frog explained to them that he was deaf. He thought they were encouraging him the entire time.

\fs32 This story teaches two lessons:
\fs24 \

\fs32 1. There is power of life and death in the tongue. An encouraging word to someone who is down can lift them up and help them make it through the day.
\fs24 \

\fs32 2. A destructive word to someone who is down can be what it takes to kill them.
\fs24 \

\fs32 Be careful of what you say. Speak life to those who cross your path. The power of words... it is sometimes hard to understand that an encouraging word can go such a long way. Anyone can speak words that tend to rob another of the spirit to continue in difficult times. Special is the individual who will take the time to encourage another.

Despite their seemingly hopeless condition, two of Albrecht Durer the Elder\'92s children had a dream. They both wanted to pursue their talent for art, but they knew full well that their father would never be financially able to send either of them to Nuremberg to study at the Academy.After many long discussions at night in their crowded bed, the two boys finally worked out a pact.

\fs32 brother at the academy, either with sales of his artwork or, if necessary, also by laboring in the mines.They tossed a coin on a Sunday morning after church. Albrecht Durer won the toss and went off to Nuremberg. Albert went down into the dangerous mines and, for the next four years, financed his brother, whose work at the academy was almost an immediate sensation. Albrecht\'92s etchings, his woodcuts, and his oils were far better than those of most of his professors, and by the time he graduated, he was beginning to earn considerable fees for his commissioned works.When the young artist returned to his village, the Durer family held a festive dinner on their lawn to celebrate Albrecht\'92s triumphant homecoming. After a long and memorable meal, punctuated with music and laughter, Albrecht rose from his honored position at the head of the table to drink a toast to his beloved brother for the years of sacrifice that had enabled Albrecht to fulfill his ambition. His closing words were, \'93And now, Albert, blessed brother of mine, now it is your turn. Now you can go to Nuremberg to pursue your dream, and I will take care of you.\'94All heads turned in eager expectation to the far end of the table where Albert sat, tears streaming down his pale face, shaking his lowered head from side to side while he sobbed and repeated, over and over, \'93No ...no ...no ...no.\'94
\fs24 \

\fs32 Finally, Albert rose and wiped the tears from his cheeks. He glanced down the long table at the faces he loved, and then, holding his hands close to his right cheek, he said softly, \'93No, brother. I cannot go to Nuremberg. It is too late for me. Look ... looks what four years in the mines have done to my hands! The bones in every finger have been smashed at least once, and lately I have been suffering from arthritis so badly in my right hand that I cannot even hold a glass to return your toast, much less make delicate lines on parchment or canvas with a pen or a brush. No, brother ... for me it is too late.\'94

More than merely being familiar with it, you very well may have a reproduction hanging in your home or office.

When I die, will you follow me and keep me company?\'94 \'93I\'92m sorry, I can\'92t help you out this time!\'94 replied the 2nd wife. \'93At the very most, I can only send you to your grave.\'94 The answer came like a bolt of thunder and the merchant was devastated.
\fs24 \

\fs32 Then a voice called out: \'93I\'92ll leave with you. I\'92ll follow you no matter where you go.\'94 The merchant looked up and there was his first wife.

\fs24 \

\fs32 Actually, we all have 4 wives in our lives
\fs24 \

\fs32 a. The 4th wife is our body. No matter how much time and effort we lavish in making it look good, it\'92ll leave us when we die.
\fs24 \

\fs32 b. Our 3rd wife? Our possessions, status and wealth. When we die, they all go to others.
\fs24 \

\fs32 c. The 2nd wife is our family and friends. No matter how close they had been there for us when we\'92re alive, the furthest they can stay by us is up to the grave.
\fs24 \

\fs32 d. The 1st wife is in fact our soul, often neglected in our pursuit of material, wealth and sensual pleasure.
\fs24 \

\fs32 Guess what? It is actually the only thing that follows us wherever we go. Perhaps it\'92s a good idea to cultivate and strengthen it now rather than to wait until we\'92re on our deathbed to lament

\fs32 \cf0 A young and successful executive was traveling down a neighborhood street, going a bit too fast in his new Jaguar. He was watching for kids darting out from between parked cars and slowed down when he thought he saw something. As his car passed, no children appeared. Instead, a brick smashed into the Jag\'92s side door! He slammed on the brakes and drove the Jag back to the spot where the brick had been thrown. The angry driver then jumped out of the car, grabbed the nearest kid and pushed him up against a parked car, shouting, \'93What was that all about and who are you? Just what the heck are you doing?

\fs32 That\'92s a new car and that brick you threw is going to cost a lot of money. Why did you do it?\'94
\fs24 \

\fs32 The young boy was apologetic. \'93Please mister ... please, I\'92m sorry... I didn\'92t know what else to do,\'94 he pleaded. \'93I threw the brick because no one else would stop...\'94
\fs24 \

\fs32 With tears dripping down his face and off his chin, the youth pointed to a spot just around a parked car. \'93It\'92s my brother,\'94 he said. \'93He rolled off the curb and fell out of his wheelchair and I can\'92t lift him up.\'94
\fs24 \

\fs32 Now sobbing, the boy asked the stunned executive, \'93Would you please help me get him back into his wheelchair? He\'92s hurt and he\'92s too heavy for me.\'94 Moved beyond words, the driver tried to swallow the rapidly swelling lump in his throat. He hurriedly lifted the handicapped boy back into the wheelchair, then took out his fancy handkerchief and dabbed at the fresh scrapes and cuts. A quick look told him everything was going to be okay.
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Thank you and may God bless you,\'94 the grateful child told the stranger. Too shook up for words, the man simply watched the little boy push his wheelchair-bound brother down the sidewalk toward their home. It was a long, slow walk back to the Jaguar. The damage was very noticeable, but the driver never bothered to repair the dented side door. He kept the dent there to remind him of this message: Don\'92t go through life so fast that someone has to throw a brick at you to get your attention!
\fs24 \

\fs32 God whispers in our souls and speaks to our hearts. Sometimes when we don\'92t have time to listen, He has to throw a brick at us.

\fs32 And with that he let out a whistle, \'93Here, Dolly!\'94 he called.

\fs32 Out from the doghouse and down the ramp ran Dolly followed by four little balls of fur. The little boy pressed his face against the chain link fence. His eyes danced with delight.
\fs24 \

\fs32 As the dogs made their way to the fence, the little boy noticed something else stirring inside the doghouse. Slowly another little ball appeared; this One noticeably smaller. Down the ramp it slid. Then in a somewhat awkward manner the little pup began hobbling toward the others, doing its best to catch up.... \'93I want that one,\'94 the little boy said, pointing to the runt.
\fs24 \

\fs32 The farmer knelt down at the boy\'92s side and said, \'93Son, you don\'92t want that puppy. He will never be able to run and play with you like these other dogs would.\'94 With that the little boy stepped back from the fence, reached down, and began rolling up one leg of his trousers. In doing so he revealed a steel brace running down both sides of his leg attaching itself to a specially made shoe. Looking back up at the farmer, he said, \'93You see sir, I don\'92t run too well myself, and he will need someone who understands.\'94

\fs32 \cf0 A frail old man went to live with his son, daughter-in-law, and a four-year old grandson. The old mans hands trembled, his eyesight was blurred, and his step faltered. The family ate together nightly at the dinner table. But the elderly grandfathers shaky hands and failing sight made eating rather difficult. Peas rolled off his spoon onto the floor. When he grasped the glass often milk spilled on the tablecloth. The son and daughter-in-law became irritated with the mess. We must do something about grandfather, said the son. Ive had enough of his spilled milk, noisy eating, and food on the floor. So the husband and wife set a small table in the corner. There, grandfather ate alone while the rest of the family enjoyed dinner at the dinner table. Since grandfather had broken a dish or two, his food was served in a wooden bowl. Sometimes when the family glanced in grandfathers direction, he had a tear in his eye as he ate alone. Still, the only words the couple had for him were sharp admonitions when he dropped a fork or spilled food. The four-year-old watched it all in silence.
\fs24 \

\fs32 One evening before supper, the father noticed his son playing with wood scraps on the floor. He asked the child sweetly, What are you making? Just as sweetly, the boy responded, Oh, I am making a little bowl for you and mama to eat your food from when I grow up. The four-year-old smiled and went back to work. The words so struck the parents that they were speechless. Then tears started to stream down their cheeks. Though no word was spoken, both knew what must be done. That evening the husband took grandfathers hand and gently led him back to the family table.

\fs24 \cf0 \strokec2 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\fs32 \cf0 Once there were three trees on a hill in the woods. They were discussing their hopes and dreams when the first tree said, Someday I hope to be a treasure chest. I could be filled with gold, silver and precious gems. I could be decorated with intricate carving and everyone would see the beauty.
\fs24 \

\fs32 Then the second tree said, Someday I will be a mighty ship. I will take kings and queens across the waters and sail to the corners of the world. Everyone will feel safe in me because of the strength of my hull.
\fs24 \

\fs32 Finally the third tree said, I want to grow to be the tallest and straightest tree in the forest. People will see me on top of the hill and look up to my branches, and think of the heavens and God and how close to them I am reaching. I will be the greatest tree of all time and people will always remember me.
\fs24 \

\fs32 After a few years of praying that their dreams would come true, a group of woodsmen came upon the trees. When one came to the first tree he said, This looks like a strong tree, I think I should be able to sell the wood to a carpenter ... and he began cutting it down. The tree was happy, because he knew that the carpenter would make him into a treasure chest.
\fs24 \

\fs32 At the second tree a woodsman said, This looks like a strong tree, I should be able to sell it to the shipyard. The second tree was happy because he knew he was on his way to becoming a mighty ship.

\fs32 When the woodsmen came upon the third tree, the tree was frightened because he knew that if they cut him down his dreams would not come true. One of the woodsmen said, I dont need anything special from my tree so Ill take this one, and he cut it down.
\fs24 \

\fs32 When the first tree arrived at the carpenters, he was made into a feed box for animals. He was then placed in a barn and filled with hay. This was not at all what he had prayed for. The second tree was cut and made into a small fishing boat. His dreams of being a mighty ship and carrying kings had come to an end. The third tree was cut into large pieces and left alone in the dark. The years went by, and the trees forgot about their dreams.
\fs24 \

\fs32 Then one day, a man and woman came to the barn. She gave birth and they placed the baby in the hay in the feed box that was made from the first tree. The man wished that he could have made a crib for the baby, but this manger would have to do. The tree could feel the importance of this event and knew that it had held the greatest treasure of all time. Years later, a group of men got in the fishing boat made from the second tree. One of them was tired and went to sleep. While they were out on the water, a great storm arose and the tree didnt think it was strong enough to keep the men safe. The men woke the sleeping man, and he stood and said Peace and the storm stopped. At this time, the tree knew that it had carried the King of Kings in its boat.
\fs24 \

\fs32 Finally, someone came and got the third tree. It was carried through the streets as the people mocked the man who was carrying it. When they came to a stop, the man was nailed to the tree and raised in the air to die at the top of a hill. When Sunday came, the tree came to realize that it was strong enough to stand at the top of the hill and be as close to God as was possible, because Jesus had been crucified on it.
\fs24 \

\fs32 The moral of this story is that when things dont seem to be going your way, always know that God has a plan for you. If you place your trust in Him, He will give you great gifts. Each of the trees got what they wanted, just not in the way they had imagined. We dont always know what Gods plans are for us. We just know that His ways are not our ways, but His ways are always best.

\fs32 \cf0 A young man was getting ready to graduate from college. For many months he had admired a beautiful sports car in a dealers showroom, and knowing his father could well afford it, he told him that was all he wanted.
\fs24 \

\fs32 As Graduation Day approached, the young man awaited signs that his father had purchased the car. Finally, on the morning of his graduation, his father called him into his private study. His father told him how proud he was to have such a fine son, and told him how much he loved him. He handed his son a beautifully wrapped gift box. Curious, but somewhat disappointed, the young man opened the box and found a lovely, leather-bound Bible, with the young mans name embossed in gold. Angry, he raised his voice to his father and said With all your money, you give me a Bible? and stormed out of the house, leaving the Bible.

\fs32 Many years passed and the young man was very successful in business. He had a beautiful home and wonderful family, but realized his father was very old, and thought perhaps he should go to him. He had not seen him since that graduation day. Before he could make arrangements, he received a telegram telling him his father had passed away, and willed all of his possessions to his son. He needed to come home immediately and take care of things.

\fs32 When he arrived at his fathers house, sudden sadness and regret filled his heart. He began to search through his fathers important papers and saw the still new Bible, just as he had left it years ago. With tears, he opened the Bible and began to turn the pages. And as he did, a car key dropped from the back of the Bible. It had a tag with the dealers name, the same dealer who had the sports car he had desired.

One day, she saw another much bigger cloud and she felt so much envy, than the cloud decided that in order to get bigger and grow more, her water would never abandon her, and will never start raining again.
\fs24 \

\fs32 Indeed, the cloud grew up, while his country was getting dried. First, rivers dried up, then people, animals, plants, and finally, the whole country became a desert. The cloud did not care much, but she also did not realize that by being over a desert there was no place where she could obtain new water to keep growing. So slowly, the cloud began to lose size, and was unable to do anything to stop it .
\fs24 \

\fs32 The cloud then realized her mistake, and that her greed and selfishness were the cause of her vanishing; but just before evaporating, when she was just a sigh of cotton, there started blowing a gentle breeze. The cloud was so small and weighed so little that the wind took her far away, to a faraway beautiful country, where once again she recovered her original size.

\fs32 Having learned this lesson, our cloud remained small and modest, but she became so generous when raining, that her new country became even greener, giving away to all people there the most beautiful rainbow in the world.

\fs32 The first thing Julian noticed about the city was all the rushing around. Everyone was in such a hurry that he thought that there must be something special happening that day, which no one wanted to miss. Curious as to what it was, Julian started following a man who looked like he was hurrying to see whatever it was that was happening. However, after several hours following him, the man arrived at a small flat and went inside. He had done or seen nothing of interest that whole day.
\fs24 \

\fs32 That night Julian slept in a park. The park was strewn with bits of paper and plastic. As the bins were completely empty, Julian thought how cool it was that the city had seemingly invented plants with petals made of paper and plastic. He only believed this until the following morning, when a man came by and dropped his chocolate wrapper.
\fs24 \

\fs32 Julian carried on walking through the city streets, trying to understand what was going on, when he arrived at a group of big warehouses, which many people were entering. This must be the best museum in the world, he thought, on entering, and seeing all the useless- looking things they had inside. But then he saw that people were picking these things up, paying for them, and taking them away.
\fs24 \

\fs32 Why would anyone want a watch which doesnt show the minutes? he wondered to himself, after seeing a woman very contentedly leaving with the most modern of watches on her wrist. He thought pretty much the same when seeing a pair of shoes with impossibly high heels, and then some electronic device which did a thousand things, and none of them well. Once again, he decided to follow the lady with the watch. He saw her joy turn into disappointment when her friends gave her new watch a look of disapproval. Julian started regretting having left his village, just to come to this place where no one seemed happy.
\fs24 \

\fs32 Then he saw a few kids playing. Now, they certainly did seem happy, playing, running about, chasing each other. Except for one child, who seemed troubled by a little machine they were calling a console. He was hitting it so hard with his fingers, and making all kinds of faces and angry gestures, that when one of the other children came over to invite him to play with them, the boy with the console just rudely walked away. Julian thought that the boy was trying to destroy that little machine because it was making him so unhappy. He decided to help the boy. Julian went over, took the console, threw it on the ground, stamped on it, and looked at the boy with great satisfaction.

\fs32 \cf0 Once, on the African plains, there lived a moody rhino who was very easily angered. One day, a giant turtle entered the rhinos territory unaware. The rhino quickly ran over to the turtle, with the intention of getting rid of it. The turtle was frightened and withdrew into its shell.
\fs24 \

\fs32 When the rhino demanded that the turtle get out of his territory, there was no discernible movement. The rhino was incredibly annoyed; he thought the turtle was fooling him. So he started banging the shell to make the turtle come out. No success, and his blows got increasingly violent. He whacked it with his horn, sending the poor turtle flying in all directions. From a distance, it looked a bit like a solitary game of football, with the turtle as the ball.
\fs24 \

\fs32 Quite an amusing spectacle, it was, and a load of monkeys soon gathered close by to enjoy it. They laughed non-stop at the angry rhino and his struggle with the turtle.
\fs24 \

\fs32 The rhino was so furious that he didnt even notice that they were there. On he went, until he had to stop for a second to get his breath.
\fs24 \

\fs32 Now that he wasnt bashing the shell, he could hear the laughing and joking of the monkeys, who were making fun of him in every way you can imagine.

This time the rhino very quietly retreated a few steps, looked at the turtle, looked at the monkeys, took a run up, and shot the giant turtle, with such a good aim, that it seemed like he was using the monkeys as skittles.

Meanwhile, off went the rhino and the turtle, smiling like old friends... and while the monkeys were putting on their sticking plasters, their chief realised it was about time they found a better way to amuse themselves than making fun of others.

\fs32 \cf0 That year, in the local school, there was a new Math teacher, as well as some new pupils. One of the new kids was the stupidest child anyone had ever seen. It made no difference how quickly or how slowly they tried explaining numbers to him; he would always end up saying something enormously dumb. Like two plus two was five, seven times three was twenty-seven, or a triangle had thirty corners...
\fs24 \

\fs32 Before this boy arrived, Maths lessons had been the most boring of all. Now they were great fun. Encouraged by the new teacher, the children would listen to the pieces of nonsense spouted by the new kid, and they would have to correct his mistakes.
\fs24 \

\fs32 They all wanted to be the first to find his mistakes, and then think up the most original ways to explain them. To do this they used all kinds of stuff: sweets, playing cards, oranges, paper planes...
\fs24 \

\fs32 It didnt seem like any of this bothered the new kid.\uc0\u8232 However, little Lewis was sure that it was bound to make him feel sad inside.
\fs24 \

\fs32 So, one day, he decided to follow the new kid home after school; Lewis was sure he would see him crying.
\fs24 \

\fs32 On leaving school, the new kid walked a few minutes to a local park, and there he waited for a while, until someone came along to meet him...
\fs24 \

\fs32 It was the new teacher!
\fs24 \

\fs32 The teacher gave the new kid a hug, and off they went, hand in hand. Following from a distance, Lewis could hear they were talking about Math.

\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\fs32 \cf0 In a garden filled with bushes, out from between a load of grass and weeds, there appeared, as if from nowhere, a white rose. It was as white as driven snow, its petals looked like velvet, and the morning dew shone from its leaves like resplendent crystals. The flower couldn\'92t see herself, so she had no idea how pretty she was. And so it was that she spent the few days of her life, until wilting set on, without knowing that all around her were amazed by her and her perfection: her perfume, the softness of her petals, her elegance. She didn\'92t realise that everyone who saw her spoke well of her. The weeds that surrounded her were fascinated by her beauty, and lived in a state of enchantment at her aroma and appearance.
\fs24 \

\fs32 One hot, sunny day, a girl was strolling through the garden, thinking about how many lovely things Mother Nature has given us, when she suddenly saw a white rose in a forgotten part of the garden. The rose was beginning to fade and wilt.
\fs24 \

\fs32 -\'93It\'92s days since it rained,\'94 she thought,
\fs24 \

\fs32 -\'93if the rose stays here till tomorrow itll be totally withered. I\'92ll take it home and put it in the lovely vase I got as a present.\'94
\fs24 \

\fs32 And so she did. With all her love she put the wilting white rose in water, inside a lovely colourful glass vase, and placed it by the window.
\fs24 \

\fs32 -Ill put it here,

\fs32 she thought,
\fs24 \

\fs32 -so the flower can get some sun.
\fs24 \

\fs32 What the young girl didn\'92t realise was that the reflection from the window meant that, for the first time, the rose got to see herself and what she looked like.
\fs24 \

\fs32 -\'93Is that me?\'94
\fs24 \

\fs32 thought the rose. Little by little her drooping leaves began to rise, once again stretching up towards the sun, and, gradually, the rose recovered her former appearance. When she was

\fs32 The rose came to realise she had spent her days without appreciating her beauty, unable to see herself, unable to know who she really was.

\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\fs32 \cf0 In the palace of Rubyland there was a ruby thief. No one knew who it was, and the thief had everyone so fooled that the only thing known about him was that he lived in the palace, and that when you were in the palace you should always hide your jewels.
\fs24 \

\fs32 The King decided to find out who it was, and he asked for help from a wise dwarf who was famed for his intelligence. The dwarf spent some days there, watching and listening, until their was another theft. The following morning the wise dwarf made all the palace inhabitants meet up together in the same room. After inspecting them for the whole morning, and during lunch, without saying a word, the dwarf started asking them all, one by one, what they knew about the stolen jewels.
\fs24 \

\fs32 Once again, it seemed that no one had been the thief. But then, suddenly, one of the gardeners began coughing, writhing and moaning, and finally he fell to the floor.
\fs24 \

\fs32 The dwarf, with a cheeky smile, explained that the food they had just eaten was poisoned, and the only antidote for this poison was hidden inside the ruby that had been stolen the previous night. And he explained how, some days earlier, he himself had swapped some false rubies for the genuine ones, and that he expected that only the thief would be able to save his life, since the poison was particularly quick working...
\fs24 \

\fs32 The coughs and groans spread around the room, and terror took hold of all present. All except one person. A footman didn\'92t take long to run over to where he had hidden the jewels, from where he took the final ruby. Fortunately he would be able to open it and drink the strange liquid inside, thus saving his life.

\fs32 Or so he believed, because the gardener was, in fact, one of the dwarf\'92s assistants, and the poison was nothing more than a potion prepared by the little investigator to cause a few strong pains for a short while, but nothing more than that. And the footman, now found out, was arrested by the guards and taken immediately to court.
\fs24 \

\fs32 The King, grateful, generously rewarded his wise adviser, and when he asked the dwarf what his secret was, the dwarf smiled and said:
\fs24 \

\fs32 -\'93I only try to get the person knowing the truth to reveal that truth.\'94 -\'93And who knew it? If the thief had deceived everyone...

\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\fs32 \cf0 Pinty Tailor was a little boy who enjoyed going to school and doing all sorts of things, except for art and writing. Using brushes and pencils did not come easy to Pinty, so his works of art did not end happily, and he would just give up in disgust.
\fs24 \

\fs32 But one day Pinty found a pencil of such lovely colours that he could not resist, and he tried drawing a circle. As ever, it did not go well, and he was about to throw the pencil away when his drawing began to speak to him.
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'91Psst! You aren\'92t going to leave me like this, are you? Come on, the least you can do is draw me a pair of eyes!\'92 said the drawing. Pinty was understandably shocked, but he managed to draw two little spots inside the circle.
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'91Much better, now I can see myself,\'92 said the circle, looking around at itself... \'91Arghh! But what have you done to me?!\'92
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'91I don\'92t draw very well,\'92 said Pinty, trying to make excuses.
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'91OK, no problem,\'92 the drawing interrupted him, \'91I\'92m sure that if you try again you\'92ll do better. Go on, rub me out!\'92 So Pinty erased the circle and drew another one. Like the first one, it was not very round.

\fs24 \

\fs32 \'91Hmmm, I think I\'92m going to have to teach you how to draw until you can do me well,\'92 said the circle with its quick, squeaky little voice.
\fs24 \

\fs32 To Pinty, who remained almost paralysed with shock, this did not seem like a bad idea, and he immediately found himself drawing and erasing circles. The circle would not stop saying \'91rub this out, but carefully; it hurts,\'92 or \'91draw me some hair, quickly, I look like a lollipop!\'92 and other funny remarks.
\fs24 \

\fs32 After spending nearly the whole afternoon together, Pinty could already draw the little figure much better than most of his classmates could have. He was enjoying it so much that he did not want to stop drawing with this crazy new teacher of his. Before going to bed that night, Pinty gave his new instructor a hearty thank you for having taught him how to draw so well.
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'91But I didn\'92t do anything, silly!\'92 answered the little drawing, in its usual quick manner.
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'91Don\'92t you see that you\'92ve been practicing a lot, and enjoying it all the while? I bet that\'92s the first time you\'92ve done that!\'92
\fs24 \

\fs32 Pinty stopped to think. The truth was that previously, he had drawn so badly because he had never practiced more than ten minutes at a time, and he had always done it angrily and grudgingly. Without doubt, what the little drawing had said was correct.
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'91OK, you\'92re right, but thank you anyway,\'92 said Pinty, and before he went to bed he carefully placed the pencil in his school bag.
\fs24 \

\fs32 The next morning Pinty jumped out of bed and went running to find his pencil, but it was not there. He searched everywhere, but there was no sign of it. And the sheet of paper on which he had drawn the little figure, although still full of rubbing out marks, was completely blank. Pinty began to worry, and he did not know if he had really spent the previous afternoon talking with the little man or whether he had dreamt the whole thing.
\fs24 \

\fs32 So, to try to settle the matter, he took a pencil and some paper and tried to draw a little man.

\fs32 It turned out not bad at all, except for a couple of jagged lines. He imagined his bossy little teacher telling him to round out those edges, and that it looked like he was trying to give him spots. Pinty gladly rubbed out those bits and redrew them. He realised that the crazy little teacher had been right: it made no difference whether you had the magic pencil or not; to manage to do things, you only needed to keep trying and to enjoy doing so.
\fs24 \

\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\fs32 \cf0 Once upon a time, a hippopotamus lived in a river next to a big and solitary tree.
\fs24 \

\fs32 One day, a bird came and nested in the tree. The songs and the flight of the bird caused such envy in the hippo that he couldnt think of anything else. Every day he would lament the fact that he had been born a hippo. This, despite the many times the bird told the hippo he was so lucky to be so big and such a good swimmer.
\fs24 \

\fs32 Finally, the hippo made his mind up that he would come out of the river, climb the tree, go out to perch on a branch, and start singing. However, when he tried to climb the tree it was all too clear that the hippo didnt have wings, nor claws to climb with, and neither could he hop.
\fs24 \

\fs32 Realising that he would never manage it, he angrily rammed his whole weight against the tree until it came crashing to the ground. Then, triumphantly, he stepped onto the leaves of the fallen tree, and began singing.
\fs24 \

\fs32 Unfortunately, hippos cant sing either. All that came from his mouth were horrible noises, and when the other animals heard this they all gathered round to make fun of the hippo standing on the branch of a fallen tree, trying to sing like a bird.
\fs24 \

\fs32 He was so embarrassed by this that he decided to never again regret being a hippo. He also felt bad about having knocked the tree over. He used all his strength to raise the tree back up again, replant it, and look after it until it had completely recovered.

\fs32 \cf0 Gus Grumplings was never happy with anything. He had lots of friends, and parents who loved him dearly, but all Gus could think about was what he didnt have, or things he did have which he was unhappy with. If someone gave him a car, it would be too big or too slow. If he went to the zoo, hed come back disappointed because they hadnt let him feed the lions. If he played football with his friends, he would complain, saying there were too many of them for just one ball...
\fs24 \

\fs32 What caught Gus unawares was Chuckles the prankster cloud. One day, Chuckles was drifting past, and heard all of Guss complaining. Chuckles wafted over to see. When the cloud was right above Gus, he started dropping heavy black rain on him. That was Chuckles favourite trick to play on grumpy little kids.
\fs24 \

\fs32 Gus wasnt at all impressed by this new development; it just made him complain even more. He was even angrier after he realised that the cloud was following him.
\fs24 \

\fs32 Well, this carried on for almost a week. Gus couldnt get away from the cloud, and he got more and more infuriated.
\fs24 \

\fs32 Gus had a little friend, a happy and generous girl called Gladys. Gladys was the only one who had been willing to hang around with Gus during all those black, rainy days. All the other children had run off to avoid getting soaked and ending up completely black.
\fs24 \

\fs32 One day, when Gus was at the end of his tether, she said to him: Cheer up! What you should realise is that youre the only one of us who has his very own cloud, and even better, its rain is black! We could play some fun games with a cloud like this, dont you reckon? As Gladys was his only company these days, and he didnt want her to leave as the others had, Gus reluctantly agreed.
\fs24 \

\fs32 Gladys took him to the swimming pool, and left him there until all the pool water was black. Then she went and got other kids. They came and played in the pool. The water being black meant they could play hide and seek! Grudgingly, Gus had to admit it had been a lot of fun, but what was even more fun was playing Wet the Cat.

\fs32 For the first time ever, Gus started to see the positive side of things; even things which, at first, had seemed so bad. Chuckles, the prankster cloud, thought that he could now leave; his work had been done. But, before leaving, he gave Gus two days of multicoloured rain, with which the children invented the most fun games ever.
\fs24 \

\fs32 When Chuckles finally left, Gus didnt complain. Now he knew to focus on the good in life, and the good thing about Chuckles departure was that no longer was Gus soaking wet all day. Now he could go and do dry things, and thats exactly what he did.

\fs32 \cf0 Once upon a time there was a spring who lived happily and safely inside a pen. Although he heard many noises coming from outside, he lived believing that outside his world inside the pen, there was nothing good. Even just to think about leaving his pen made him so scared that he was quite content to spend his life compacting and stretching himself again and again inside that tiny space.
\fs24 \

\fs32 However, one day, the ink ran out, and when the pens owner was busy changing it, there was an accident. The spring was flung through the air and landed in the toilet drain, well out of sight. Terrified, and cursing his bad luck, the spring was flushed through pipe after pipe, each time thinking it might be his end. During the journey, he did not dare open his eyes out of pure fear. Nor did he every stop crying. Swept away by the water, he travelled on and on and on, until he ended up in a river. When the river current lost its force, and the spring could see that things had calmed down a bit, he stopped crying and listened all around him. Hearing birdsong and wind in the trees, he felt encouraged to finally open his eyes. What the spring saw was the pure, crystal waters of the river, the rich green rocks of the riverbed, and all kinds of fish of many colours, whose skin seemed to dance under the sunlight. Now he understood that the world was much greater than the space inside the pen, and that there had always been many things outside, waiting to be enjoyed.

\fs32 After spending a while playing with the fish, he went over to the riverbank, and then moved on to a field of flowers. There he heard weeping.

\fs32 \cf0 Once upon a time there was a river. This river was rather unfriendly and lonesome. The river could not remember how long ago he had decided that he no longer wanted to put up with anything or anyone. He lived alone, refusing to share his water with any fish, plant or animal.
\fs24 \

\fs32 And so his life went on, sadly and filled with loneliness, for many centuries.
\fs24 \

\fs32 One day, a little girl with a goldfish bowl came to the bank of this river. In the bowl lived Scamp, her favourite little fish. The girl was about to move to another country, and she wouldnt be able to take Scamp with her. So she had decided to give Scamp his freedom.
\fs24 \

\fs32 When Scamp fell into the river, he immediately felt the rivers loneliness. Scamp tried talking to the river, but the river told Scamp to go away. Now, Scamp was a very happy little fish, and he wasnt going to give up so easily. He asked and asked, swam and swam, and finally he started jumping in and out of the water.

\fs32 \cf0 One day, in the jungle, a set of bathroom scales appeared. The animals played with it for quite some time until a parrot who had escaped from the zoo explained to them how it worked. All the animals took turns to weigh themselves. At first this was a big game; every day each animal would see how much weight they had gained or lost. However, before long, many animals began to obsess about their weight. The first thing they would do each day would be to run to the scales, weigh themselves, and spend the rest of the day with a grumpy expression on their faces. This because, no matter what the scales said, the animals always weighed the same, in other words: more than they wanted to.
\fs24 \

\fs32 As the months passed, the scales began to suffer the animals\'92 disapproval. The scales were regularly kicked, or given poisonous looks. One day, the scales decided that from the following morning things would have to change.
\fs24 \

\fs32 That morning, the first to run to weigh itself was the zebra. However, as soon as it stepped onto the scales, the scales began tickling the zebra\'92s hooves. Soon the scales found just the right spot, and the zebra couldn\'92t stop giggling. This was so much fun for the zebra that from that day on it no longer worried about its weight, and off it went to happily eat its breakfast for the first time in ages. The same happened to whoever went to weigh themselves that day... so that, before long, no one was worried any longer about their weight. Rather, they all commented on how much fun the scales and its tickling were.
\fs24 \

\fs32 As the months and the years passed, the scales stopped reading weight and began reading good humour and optimism instead. Soon everyone happily discovered that this was a much better indicator of beauty and a person\'92s value.

\fs32 Finally, though, his parents found him. The boy had had such a regrettable day that never again did he want to be mistaken for anything other than a human being. Nowadays hes the first to get dressed, and look perfectly neat and tidy, just like those children in the clothes catalogues

\fs32 \cf0 Gail the Whale lived in a small salty lake. She was the only whale in that territory, and she led a very comfortable life. In fact, this easy life made her a bit fussy. But, one year, there was such an incredibly hot summer that the lakes water really warmed up. Gail, used to such an ideal existence, could hardly stand the hot water. A little fish, which had spent some time in a childs goldfish bowl, told Gail that humans used fans to cool themselves down in summer. From then on, Gail the Whale couldnt think of anything else apart from how to build her very own fan.
\fs24 \

\fs32 Everyone told her that she was overreacting, and that the hot weather would soon pass, but Gail got to work, constructing her enormous fan. When it was finally finished, she started fanning away at herself.

\fs32 Unlucky for the fish! The giant fan beat the little lakes waters so strongly that huge waves rolled right across it. The waves crashed onto the lakeshore, leaving the lake half empty, and Gail stranded in only a few inches of water.
\fs24 \

\fs32 You couldnt just hang on for while. You had to empty the lake, some unhappy-looking fish berated her. So impatient! So selfish! others shouted. But the worst of it for Gail was not the insults, but the fact that with so little water around her, the heat was becoming unbearable. Preparing herself to die of heatstroke, she said her goodbyes to all her friends, and they asked for her forgiveness. She assured them all that if she were to live again she would be stronger and learn to put up with lifes discomforts.
\fs24 \

\fs32 Yet, once again, Gail the Whale was overreacting. She managed to survive those hot days without dying, although, of course, she suffered. When the next rains arrived, the lake filled up again, and the weather improved. Naturally, Gail had to keep her promise, and show everyone that she had learned not to be so dependent on comfort, so impatient, and so fussy.

\fs32 \cf0 Once upon a time there was a little boy who became very ill. He had to spend all day in bed, unable to move. Because other children werent allowed to come near him, he suffered greatly, and spent his days feeling sad and blue.
\fs24 \

\fs32 There wasnt much he could do except look out of the window. Time passed, and his feeling of despair just grew. Until one day he saw a strange shape in the window. It was a penguin eating a sausage sandwich. The penguin squeezed in through the open window, said good afternoon to the boy, turned around, and left again.
\fs24 \

\fs32 Of course, the boy was very surprised. He was still trying to work out what had happened, when outside his window he saw a monkey in a nappy, busy blowing up a balloon. At first the boy asked himself what that could possibly be, but after a while, as more and more crazy-looking characters appeared out the window, he burst out laughing and found it hard to stop.
\fs24 \

\fs32 Anyone wanting to stop laughing would never be helped by seeing a pig playing a tambourine, an elephant jumping on a trampoline, or a dog wearing a pair of glasses and talking about nothing except politics. The little boy didnt tell anyone about this because
\fs24 \

\fs32 who would have believed him? Even so, those strange characters ended up putting joy back

\fs24 \

\fs32 There he got to talk to his friends, and tell them all the strange things he had seen. While he was talking to his best friend he saw something sticking out of his friends school bag. The boy asked his friend what it was, and he was so insistent that finally his friend had to show him what was in the bag:
\fs24 \

\fs32 There, inside, were all the fancy-dress suits and disguises that his best friend had been using to try to cheer the little boy up!
\fs24 \

\fs32 And from that day on, the little boy always did his best to make sure that no one felt sad and alone.
